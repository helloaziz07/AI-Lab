Established in 2015, we are a fully licensed software development and IT solutions provider delivering enterprise-grade software, cloud services, and specialized digital solutions across Greenfield, Riverbend, and Northport, with partner coverage for nationwide and international clients. Our registered office is at 12 Harbor Road, Riverbend, State of Aurora, 560102. Registration number REG-2015-7843 and GSTIN GSTIN-AUR-0001234 are used for administrative purposes. Our mission is to deliver secure, scalable, and high-quality software with transparent pricing, real-time project visibility, and reliable customer service available Monday–Saturday, 09:00–18:00 IST, with enterprise 24×7 support options under contract. We operate a hybrid model combining in-house teams and partner-managed resources to ensure flexible capacity and global delivery coverage.

Our service portfolio includes web and mobile application development, custom enterprise software, SaaS platforms, cloud migration and management, data analytics and AI/ML solutions, API development and integration, cybersecurity consulting, IT support and maintenance, DevOps and CI/CD pipeline automation, and tailored project-based digital solutions. International clients are served through vetted technology partners and offshore teams; customers are expected to provide necessary project specifications, content, and access credentials unless otherwise agreed. For specialized implementations such as ERP, CRM, or large-scale system migrations, we conduct detailed project scoping and provide quotes that account for design, development, testing, deployment, and any required third-party licenses.

Our technology stack and resources include 120 skilled developers, QA engineers, and DevOps specialists, equipped with modern tools such as Git, Jira, Docker, Kubernetes, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), and collaboration software. Every project follows a structured SDLC process with mandatory code reviews, security audits, and version-controlled deployment. Bookings or project engagements can be initiated via website, email, phone, or API: clients submit requirements with project scope, deadlines, expected deliverables, and any special instructions, confirm engagement, and choose payment (prepaid milestone-based or post-delivery billing). Project timelines are scheduled at engagement with progress updates provided regularly; delivery estimates vary by project size and complexity.

Pricing is calculated based on project scope, complexity, man-hours, technology stack, required third-party licenses, cloud costs, and service type (standard or expedited). Hourly rates, fixed-price contracts, or subscription-based SaaS models are offered depending on the engagement type. All invoices are GST-compliant and itemized, showing taxes, surcharges, and milestone-based charges; enterprise clients can opt for consolidated monthly billing. Discounts and volume pricing are available for long-term contracts, recurring projects, or strategic partnerships, with seasonal promotional codes applied where applicable.

Real-time project tracking is provided through dashboards on our website and app with automated email/SMS milestone updates for sprints, releases, and deployments. Business clients receive API access and webhooks for automated integration; sample endpoints include https://api.software.example/quote
, https://api.software.example/engage
, https://api.software.example/track/{id}
, and https://api.software.example/cancel/{id}
, with sandbox access and API keys provided during onboarding. Delivery proofs include deployment reports, test case results, release notes, and version-tagged builds — accessible through the client portal and emailed post-delivery.

Documentation requirements depend on project type: standard software modules require functional specifications, wireframes/mockups, and acceptance criteria; high-value or enterprise solutions require detailed SRS, design documentation, and compliance certifications. Hazardous or illegal code practices, malware, or unauthorized software components are strictly prohibited; software must comply with applicable licenses and industry standards. Sensitive data handling and security compliance (ISO 27001, GDPR, etc.) are ensured in all projects.

Project insurance and liability are offered for high-value implementations or critical enterprise systems. Standard liability limits apply by default and are disclosed in the engagement contract. In the event of issues or failures, clients must file claims within seven days of delivery with project reference, deployment logs, screenshots, and completed claim forms. Claims are acknowledged within two business days and typically resolved within 7–21 business days depending on complexity; exact SLAs are detailed in the contract.

Cancellation and rescheduling are allowed prior to project kickoff subject to tariffs and availability, with partial refunds where applicable; repeated changes may incur additional fees. Payment methods include online card/UPI/netbanking, NEFT/RTGS, popular wallets, and corporate monthly invoicing for approved accounts. Maintenance, support, and upgrade services are scheduled via client portal or customer support, with charges depending on scope and contract terms.

Customer support triage is immediate during support hours via phone and chat, with email tickets acknowledged within 12 business hours for standard clients and accelerated SLAs for enterprise accounts. For unresolved issues, clients are routed from support to account managers or the grievance/legal contact at legal@software.co
 or +91-98765-43210; escalation procedures are provided during onboarding. Privacy and data security are enforced through role-based access controls and encrypted storage where appropriate; client project data, credentials, and communication are retained to provide services and processed in accordance with applicable privacy laws. API keys and credentials must be kept secure by clients.
